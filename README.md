# Automated Log Analysis Review
## Final project for Specialization in Data Science (Instituto TecnolÃ³gico de Buenos Aires)

> In this project, data was gathered from various research papers working on Automated Log Analysis using Machine Learning, and a series of visualisations was then generated with this data.

> The visualisations can be seen in the following [ObservableHQ Notebook](https://observablehq.com/@txaboitiz/automated_log_analysis)

> This repo contains the data generated (in .tsv format) with various key aspects of the research papers. The tables are described in `data/table_details.tsv`.
