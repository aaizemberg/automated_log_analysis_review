# Automated Log Analysis Review
## Final project for Specialization in Data Science (Instituto TecnolÃ³gico de Buenos Aires')

> In this project, I gathered data from various research papers working on Automated Log Analysis using Machine Learning, and generated a series of visualisations with these data.

> The visualisations can be seen in the following [ObservableHQ Notebook](https://observablehq.com/@txaboitiz/automated_log_analysis)

> This repo contains the bibliography used to gather the data, and the tables created (in .tsv format) with various key aspects of the research papers. The tables are described in `data/table_details.tsv`.
